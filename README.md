SRP Project
Single Responsibility Principle:
    - When a class if modified, all the responsibilities need to be tested.
    - Whenever any class is modified , each and every class needs to be tested.
    - To minimize effort and minimize the responsibilities, we use SRP.
    - A class should have onle one responsibility/ one reason to change/update.
